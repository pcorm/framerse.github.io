# Notes that he said would be on exam:

# To write a python function you have to start out with:
# def name_of_function():
#     first_line
#     second_line

# The way that you write code without functions and how we have written functions previously is called 'unstructured'

# "Keeping your code dry" is not repeating yourself when writing code. Functions help to keep code dry

# There is going to be a question that says "write a question that returns. And the last line in your function is going to say 'return'""
